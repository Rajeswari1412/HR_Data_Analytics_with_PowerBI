### Project 1: HR Data Analytics with PowerBI

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize HR data to gain insights into employee performance and attrition. The data used for this analysis includes employee job-related data, performance metrics, and attrition data.

-To begin the analysis, I first imported the data into Power BI and cleaned and transformed using Power Query as needed. I then created several visualizations to help me explore the data and identify trends and patterns. 
Some of the visualizations I created include:

-A Table chart showing the presence,work from home patterns and leaves of employees for every months. This visualization helped me identify the involvement of an employee in the Company.

-A Area chart showing the trend in employee attendance over time. This visualization helped me identify any seasonal or trend patterns in employee attendance.

-A Pie chart showing the distribution of employee in a week. This visualization helped me identify on which day of the week employees had the highest attendance rates.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize HR data to gain insights into employee performance and involvement. By using visualizations to explore the data, it is possible to identify trends and patterns that would be difficult to detect using traditional analysis methods.
